# Empty Wallet

A client wrapping the [Free Game API](https://www.freetogame.com/) allowing users to find free to play games based on their search criteria.



## Matching the GD profile
At DAE we are all broke students and need some DA**Entertainment** once in a while.

This is why I have chosen to provide all my fellow students with a way to easily find free games to enjoy and **empty** their **wallet** with :)


## How to use
Select the game you want to view and press show selected game.
You can use the bottom right button to switch between the local and online repo.
